# Simulating-Electrochemical-Reactions-with-Mathematica
Notebooks from the out of print book "Simulating Electrochemical Reactions with Mathematica" by Michael Honeychurch that were originally written in versions 4 & 5 of Mathematica and have now have been updated to version 13 of Mathematica.
There are 15 chapter notebooks, two appendix notebooks, an initialization notebook, and a stylesheet SERM.nb. There is a folder containing test data and a folder containing specific example notebooks.
While the code has been updated to run in Version 13 the intent remains to provide stepwise explanations of how to solve some problems in electrochemistry. An experienced user could further optimize the code and make it more concise but my intent was to enable a relatively new user to read through the code step by step.
The notebooks will also provide an example of typesetting and stylesheeting in Mathematica emphasising the flexibility of the notebook interface.
